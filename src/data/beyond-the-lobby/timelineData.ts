    title: "Yugoslavia Before the War",
    content: "Yugoslavia, formed after World War I, was united under a socialist federation led by Josip Broz Tito until his death in 1980. After his passing–and with the fall of communism across Eastern Europe–a surge of nationalism and ethnic tensions rose. Calls for independence grew stronger, and in 1991, Slovenia and Croatia were the first republics to declare independence.",

    title: "War Begins",
    content: "Following Bosnia and Herzegovina’s declaration of independence, violence erupted across the country as Bosnian Serb forces, supported by the Yugoslav People’s Army and Serbian paramilitary groups, launched a coordinated campaign of attacks. Cities and towns with significant Bosniak populations were targeted, leading to widespread ethnic cleansing, the establishment of concentration camps, civilian massacres, and the displacement of millions.",

    title: "War within a War",
    content: "While the broader Bosnian War continued, a separate conflict erupted between Bosniak and Croat forces–former allies–adding new divisions and devastation, particularly in central Bosnia. Meanwhile, the United Nations expanded its presence in Bosnia, focusing on humanitarian aid and the designation of  “safe areas,” though its ability to intervene in the violence remained limited.",

    title: "Nato’s Role",
    content: "As peace negotiations stalled and Bosnian Serbs maintained control over much of the country, NATO began taking a more active role in the conflict. 1994 marked the alliance’s first-ever combat operations, including enforcing the no-fly zone and launching limited airstrikes to protect UN-designated “safe areas.” Though initial efforts had minimal effect, they marked a turning point in international military involvement.",

    title: "End of the War",
    content: "The genocide in Srebrenica intensified pressure for international intervention. The massacre–along with continued violence–led to a NATO bombing campaign and a joint Bosniak-Croat offensive that forced Bosnian Serb leaders to the negotiating table. The US-brokered Dayton Accords, ended the war in 1995, though the resulting peace came with a complex political system that continues to challenge unity in Bosnia today.",
