His work has been seen at Hudson Valley Shakespeare, Theater for the New City, Boise Contemporary Theater, Alley Repertory Theater, and The Spot. Collaborating with these inspiring companies and ensembles fueled his desire to build Little Branch Theater—a space where artists can learn, take risks, fail spectacularly, and create something extraordinary. He would not be able to do any of this without the creativity and support of his wife. Among his favorite roles, playing Oscar in Sweat by Lynn Nottage was a particularly meaningful experience.",
